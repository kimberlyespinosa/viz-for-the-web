    <div class="land-acknowledgement">
      <p>As students, we acknowledge that the Northwestern University, San Francisco campus is located on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. Before ‘California’ was part of the United States, Mexico, or Spain, the City and County of San Francisco was inhabited by the Yelamu people, a tribe of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples. As students, we also recognize the importance of questioning the accuracy and completeness of the history taught through academia, primarily viewed through a Western lens. Native peoples continue to reside here as artists, community organizers, educators, engineers, doctors, scholars and much more. We, as students, wish to support the initiatives for visibility encompassing placemaking and placekeeping that the community leads. We also encourage others to do the same while thinking critically about their role for partaking in these efforts.</p>

          <p><strong>Ramaytush Ohlone Land</strong> — In the hilly streets of San Francisco, street signs serve not only as points of navigation but also as an entryway into a new culture. From the painted crosswalks of Little Italy to the large bustling Dragon Gate of Chinatown, these signs and public displays of art explore the rich tapestry of the city. These markers serve as a sign of visibility for a community.</p>
      
          <p>For the original stewards of the San Francisco peninsula, the Ohlone people, home extends beyond a drive for establishing a cultural district.</p>
          
          <p>The Indigenize SF Project is one of the American Indian Cultural District's initiatives centered on appreciating the American Indian community of San Francisco through murals, street signs, flagpole banners, and digital walking tours. </p>
          
          <p>To foster and increase the visibility, the AICD has four major areas of focus.</p>
          
          <p>The AICD team including Jason MacCanell, a consultant for the organization, have pioneered a project, Mapping Genocide, to bring awareness to the current street names in San Francisco that honor those who participated in the genocide of the Indigenous communities present in the area.</p>
          
          <p>Over 35 streets, including Lyon Street, Mason St., Hallek, Hastings and others have been found to be named after these individuals throughout the City.

      <div class="column">
          <p>“I suspect few Californians today contextualize their homes as sitting upon stolen land or land gained by bloody force or artful deceits, nor do they likely consider the social and political questions of present day Native American affairs in the light,” Brendan Lindsay, associate professor at California State University of Sacramento, said, in a video released by the AICD.</p>

          <p>Mason St. and Fort Mason are both named after Colonel Richard Barnes Mason who participated in the Gold Rush from the 1800s. Colonel Mason worked closely with John Sutter, who was responsible for bringing Native American women into Fort Mason for prostitution.</p>
            
          <p>“If you have ever been to the Civic Center … there was a statue there that we had one part removed because of its very offensive message that it was showing and that dealt with a Native American that was on his knees to a white General. People found that to be very offensive and not what we believe is social and racial equity,” Diane Matsuda, President of the Historic Preservation Commission under SF Planning, said.</p>
            
          <p>In addition to street signs, statues, monuments, and other public spaces including the name of Mission Dolores Park itself misrepresent the history of the land.</p>
         
          <p>The AICD is now formally recognized on unceded Ramaytush Ohlone land, which extends beyond what is known as the Mission District today.</p>

          <p>“I didn't know that was a thing…I didn't know [the American Indian Cultural District] existed,” said Jessica Oledan, a student at City College of San Francisco.

          <p>An original Yelamu Ohlone Village Site, named Chutchui, is now more widely known as Mission Dolores Park.</p>

          </p>
            
          <p>Oledan, who recently moved into the Mission District, said she likes to come to the Park because of proximity.</p>
            
          <p>She wishes there were more initiatives to spread awareness on the Native people and their homelands.</p>
           
          <p>[Insert quote from AICD]</p>
            
          <p>Indigenous culture has been stripped of significance for years leaving these communities void of its culture. The introduction of the AICD has created a community of individuals who aim to bring the attention that the community deserves. Drawing on the history, culture and tenacity of the Indigenous community, both past and present, the organization hopes to inform the wider San Francisco population.</p>
